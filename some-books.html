            <h1>Some Books and Authors</h1>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, I've revisited the same few ideas,
                books, authors, and Twitter accounts, and I thought I'd list
                them down here. A lot of serendipity was involved in discovering
                them, and I hope this helps someone the same way mentions,
                recommendations, and citations led me to find their work.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Nassim Taleb</h2>
            <p>
                Quantitative trader turned philosopher, Nassim Taleb's books
                have ideas with the furthest reach than any other collection of
                books I've read. Without feeling even a modicum of cringe, I can
                say that his books changed my life. If you ignore the attitude
                (or even enjoy it), it will help you understand risk,
                nonlinearity, complex systems, tail events, the fragility of
                prediction, top down vs bottom up, antifragility of tinkering,
                incentives (crucially disincentives), and more. My favorites are
                <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> and <em>Skin in the Game</em>. The
                <em>Incerto</em> is accessible in any order, but I recommend
                starting from <em>Fooled by Randomness</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Karl Popper (<em>The</em> Philosopher of Science)</h2>
            <p>
                What makes something scientific? How does one distinguish
                Science from Pseudoscience? Much of society gets a somewhat
                distorted view of what Science is about, particularly from
                famous science communicators who are prone to what can best be
                described as <em>Scientism</em>. Popper's ideas also changed how
                I think. It was eye-opening to realize that there is no 'true'
                theory, just theories that haven't been falsified yet, and the
                hallmark of a scientific theory is if it makes falsifiable
                predictions. A failed attempt at falsification makes a theory
                stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the general reader, I recommend
                <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>. And if this reminds
                you of the Soros foundation with the same name, it might
                interest you to know Soros studied philosophy under Karl Popper.
                Ironically, the Soros foundation is completely Anti-Popperian.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Sean McClure (@sean_a_mcclure on Twitter)</h2>
            <p>
                He is less famous than the previous two, but I am glad I
                discovered him on Twitter. Valuable insights that have
                complexity as their primary theme. Highly recommend
                <em>Discovered Not Designed</em>, although reading Taleb first
                as a primer might be a good idea, because otherwise you might
                think he's crazy.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Related</h2>
            <p>
                Canonical Game Theory thought experiment—everyone should know
                it. Tit-for-tat + forgiveness generalizes very easily to all of
                life, and it will instill a desire to play long-term (iterated)
                games with people as a way to succeed. Unbeknownst to most
                selfish people, the optimal way to be selfish is to be selfless,
                so just be selfless and everyone wins. However, you can't do it
                with people that don't get it intuitively. The primary goal of
                business, then, becomes finding people you can play long-term
                games with, and cutting out short-term players.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Peter Thiel (<em>Zero to One</em>)</h2>
            <p>
                Thiel is probably the only insightful techno-billionaire. Packed
                with insights on startups, business, and sales.
